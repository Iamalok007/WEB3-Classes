# Enhanced Classroom Communication with Web3 and Zego Cloud

## Key Functionalities:

- **Seamless Web3 Integration:** Enables interaction with blockchain networks, paving the way for potential applications like secure access management, decentralized content storage, and transparent record-keeping.
- **Real-time Video Chat using Zego Cloud:** Leverages Zego Cloud's robust Real-Time Communication (RTC) platform to facilitate high-quality video chat sessions between teachers and students. This fosters a more engaging and interactive learning environment.
- **Conditional Room Access:** The project implements a unique feature where users must successfully complete a transaction (potentially representing payment or authentication) before being allowed to join a classroom session. This ensures a secure and controlled learning space.

## Getting Started (Prerequisites):

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of React, Web3, and Zego Cloud concepts.

## Project Setup:

1. **Clone this repository:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git` (replace with your GitHub credentials)
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. **Start the development server:** `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)

## Zego Cloud Integration:

For integration with Zego Cloud, you'll need to create a Zego Cloud account and obtain your app ID and app secret. Follow the official Zego Cloud documentation for detailed instructions: [Zego Cloud Documentation](https://www.zegocloud.com/)

## Web3 Setup:

This project likely interacts with blockchain networks using a Web3 library like ethers.js. Refer to the library's documentation for configuration and usage specifics: [ethers.js Documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
